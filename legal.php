                        <p class="mb-4">Investments in the Products are speculative investments that involve high degrees of risk, including a partial or total loss of invested funds. CryptoChainSpot are not suitable for any investor that cannot afford loss of the entire investment. The shares of each Product are intended to reflect the price of the digital asset(s) held by such Product (based on digital asset(s) per share), less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities. Because each Product does not currently operate a redemption program, there can be no assurance that the value of such Product’s shares will reflect the value of the assets held by such Product, less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities, and the shares of such Product, if traded on any secondary market, may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the assets held by such Product, less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities, and such Product may be unable to meet its investment objective.
