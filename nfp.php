                  <p>The Non-farm payrolls report is one of the most anticipated economic news reports in the 
                               forex markets. It is published the first Friday of the month at 8:30AM Eastern time by the U.S. Bureau of labor statistics. 
                               
                               The data release actually includes a number of statistics, and not just the NFP(which is the change in the number of employees
                               in the country, not including farm, government, private and non- profit employees.). Another metric included in the data 
                               release is the unemployment rate.

As one of the most anticipated economic news events of the months, Integrated Binary Options Services focus mainly on currency pairs(especially those
involving the U.S. Dollar) and typically see big price movements in the minutes and hours after the data is released.
This makes it a great opportunity for our traders with a sound strategy to take advantage of the volatility.</p>
