                            <p>Carefully consider each Plan investment objectives, risk factors, fees and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in each Investment plan private placement memorandum, which may be obtained from Cryptochainspot and, for each Plan that is an SEC reporting company, the SEC’s website, or for each Products that reports under the OTC Markets Alternative Reporting Standards, the OTC Markets website. Reports prepared in accordance with the OTC Markets Alternative Reporting Standards are not prepared in accordance with SEC requirements and may not contain all information that is useful for an informed investment decision. Read these documents carefully before investing.<br><br>
 
Investments in the Products are speculative investments that involve high degrees of risk, including a partial or total loss of invested funds. Cryptochainspot are not suitable for any investor that cannot afford loss of the entire investment. The shares of each Product are intended to reflect the price of the digital asset(s) held by such Product (based on digital asset(s) per share), less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities. Because each Product does not currently operate a redemption program, there can be no assurance that the value of such Product’s shares will reflect the value of the assets held by such Product, less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities, and the shares of such Product, if traded on any secondary market, may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the assets held by such Product, less such Product’s expenses and other liabilities, and such Product may be unable to meet its investment objective.<br><br>
 
This information should not be relied upon as research, investment advice, or a recommendation regarding any products, strategies, or any security in particular. This material is strictly for illustrative, educational, or informational purposes and is subject to change.<br>
 
The shares of each Product are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (except for Products that are SEC reporting companies), the Investment Company Act of 1940, or any state securities laws. The Products are offered in private placements pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 506(c) under Regulation D of the Securities Act and are only available to accredited investors. As a result, the shares of each Plan are restricted and subject to significant limitations on reinvest and transfers. Potential investors in any Plan should carefully consider the long-term nature of an investment in that Plan prior to making an investment decision. The shares of certain Products are also publicly quoted on OTC Markets and shares that have become unrestricted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC may be bought and sold throughout the day through any brokerage account.<br><br>
 
The Products are distributed by Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (Member FINRA/SIPC, MSRB Registered).<br>
